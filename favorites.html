                    <h2>What is your favorite color?</h2>
                    <p><em>Red</em>. I like to wear red clothes as it matches my skin tone. And it is one of the two colors of our <span id="flag_text">national flag</span>. Isn't it?</p>

                    <h2>What is your favorite place in Indonesia?</h2>
                    <p><em>Labuan Bajo</em>. Maybe the best scenery in Indonesia. It is in Flores. It is less busy than Bali and I have Flores origins from my father.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>What is your favorite song?</h2>
                    <p>It might be the song <i>Yellow</i> by <b>Coldplay</b>. It reminds me good memories of a previous trip in Lombok island.</p>

                    <h2>What is your favorite food?</h2>
                    <p>It is hard to say as Indonesian cuisine offers so many tasty dishes. I would say <em>ikan bakar sambal</em>. Easy, simple and delicious.</p>

                  <h2>What would you like to change in Indonesia?</h2>
                  <p>I love my country as it offers a huge diveristy of landscapes, cultures, people and anything you can imagine. It might not be the richest country in the world financially but it is one of the richest from its diversity.</p>
                  <p>However I would like Indonesia to offer more freedom for women who are still discraminated nowadays and are facing inequalities and injustices. Both in the legislation and in the society's view. It has to change.</p>

                  <h2>Which celebrity is your role model?</h2>
                  <p>I met <em>Bunda Corla</em> in January 2023. It is a woman I admire because she is helpful, respectful and succeeded despite all the difficulties she encountered and the challenges women in general are facing in Indonesia.</p>
